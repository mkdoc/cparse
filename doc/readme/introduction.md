Fast, streaming and configurable comment parser; currently supports 30+ languages.

Designed for polyglot programmers to:

* Combine comments from various files (HTML, CSS and Javascript for example)
* Parse comments from any language
* Strip comments from any file
* Separate comments into another file
* Implement custom tag systems (annotations)
* Operate on processing instructions (see the [pi language](/API.md#pi))
* Document JSON files, read comments then strip in build process

See the [i/o sample](/EXAMPLE.md) and the [api docs](/API.md).
